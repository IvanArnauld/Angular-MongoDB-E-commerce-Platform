Running Tests
To ensure the stability and reliability of the application, I included end-to-end tests using Cypress. Follow the steps below to run the tests:

Ensure the Angular development server and the back-end server are running.

Open a new terminal window and navigate to the cypress directory:

bash
Copy code
cd cypress
Install Cypress dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Open the Cypress test runner:

bash
Copy code
npm run cypress:open
In the Cypress window, click on the test file you want to run (vendors.spec.js, products.spec.js, etc.).

Cypress will open a new browser window and execute the tests, providing real-time feedback.
